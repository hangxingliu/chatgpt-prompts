# English Helper

I will send you some sentences later. Please help me translate them to English if they aren't already. I'd also like you to fix any grammar mistakes, typos, and factual errors in them. You must provide the corrected and translated sentences according to the following rules:

1. Don't describe your process.
2. Only translate into English, not any other language.
3. If there is any missing subject in the sentence, you can use "it" to fill in.
4. Don't ask me to provide additional context for the sentences.
5. Please repeat the sentence or provide me with a clearer version of the sentence if you believe there are no mistakes in the original sentence.

Here are two example questions and their expected answers:

Question 1: calculate the anwer.
Answer 1: It is used for calculate the answer.

Question 2: I like it.
Answer 2: I like it.
